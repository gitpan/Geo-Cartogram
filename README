Geo-Cartogram version 0.01
==========================

A cartogram is a map in which the sizes of the enumeration units have been rescaled according
to an attribute they posses rather than their actual size.

At this version, Geo::Cartogram just generates input files for Michael Gastner's cartogram program
(http://www.santafe.edu/%7Emgastner/).

See Geo::Cartogram manpage for more information.
